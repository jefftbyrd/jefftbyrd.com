## [**EARTH SONG**](https://earthsong.world/) is...

- a portal for exploring the sounds of other places
- a tool for sonic inspiration
- a surprising and unpredictable sonic adventure

&nbsp;

## What does it do?

- Listen to sounds from anywhere on Earth
- Discover surprising interactions and harmonies between sounds
- Build your own soundscapes in EARTH SONG's interactive 3-dimensional Sound Portal
- Mutate and transform sounds in real-time: reverse direction, change playback speed, "tune" sounds to each other

&nbsp;

## How does it work?

- Choose a place to explore by selecting a point on the map
- EARTH SONG searches [**freesound.org**](https://freesound.org/) - a massive collaborative database of user-contributed audio recordings - for sounds from that location
- 5 sounds are selected at random and loaded into the EARTH SONG Sound Portal, a sonic playground where you can audition, manipulate and mix sounds to create your own custom sound environment
- Registered users can save and recall their favorite journeys
