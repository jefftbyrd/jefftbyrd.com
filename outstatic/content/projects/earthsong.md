## [**Earthsong**](https://earthsong.world/) is...

- a vehicle for sonic teleportation.
- a game of chance.
- a tool for sonic inspiration.
- an adventure, a surprise — totally unpredictable! \
    \
   

## What does it do?

- Generate spontaneous sound collages.
- Build your own soundscapes in EARTH SONG's interactive 3-dimensional Sound Portal.
- Discover surprising interactions and harmonies between sounds that were never meant to be heard together.
- Mutate and transform sounds in real-time: reverse direction, change playback speed, “tune” sounds to each other. \
    \
   

## How does it work?

- Choose a place to explore by selecting a point on the map.
- Sifting through [**freesound.org**](https://freesound.org/)'s vast database of user-contributed sound recordings, EARTH SONG finds audio material from the chosen geographical location.
- Through a chance operation, 5 sounds are extracted and loaded into the spatial sound player. The EARTH SONG Sound Portal is a sonic playground where you can audition, manipulate and mix sounds to create your own custom sound environment.
- Registered users can save and recall their favorite journeys.
