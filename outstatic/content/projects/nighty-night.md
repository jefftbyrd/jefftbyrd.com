> "The starting point for Nighty Night was a collection of cassette tapes my dad made in the 1980s — recordings of nothing in particular: telephone calls, thunderstorms, people talking, cars, airplanes, machinery, TV news. Augmenting these with my own field recordings (made on tape and digital over the last 20 years) and improvisations on piano, saxophone and synthesizer, I collaged and layered according to intuition rather than logic. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was caught up in a process of revisiting and reenacting my memories. Some of it is about my childhood, some about my dad (who died of cancer a couple years back) and about a city I loved and left (New Orleans). As much as the album mourns those losses, it’s also a celebration of the life these things continue to have in my imagination. The final compositions exist somewhere between autobiography and dream".
