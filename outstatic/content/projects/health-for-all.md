*Health for All* is an interactive documentary that uncovers the past, present, and future of the global movement for universal health coverage.

Released on Universal Health Coverage Day, the project marks the 30-year anniversary of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, the first international declaration underlining the importance of primary health care.

The documentary was a co-production between [**Global Health Strategies**](http://globalhealthstrategies.com/) and **Helios Design Labs** and was commissioned by [**The Rockefeller Foundation**](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/).
