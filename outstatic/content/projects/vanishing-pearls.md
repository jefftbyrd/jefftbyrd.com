**Following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, a generations-old community of African-American fishermen fight for justice, accountability and their way of life.  Nailah Jefferson’s *Vanishing Pearls* chronicles the untold story of personal and professional devastation in Pointe a la Hache, a close-knit fishing village on the Gulf coast. The filmmaker delves into the worst environmental disaster in American history just as news cameras leave the scene of the crime. While 49 Million barrels of oil settle in the once vibrant coastal waters, this community of African-American fishermen fight for their existence.**
