Windmills and oil pumps mark a horizon without beginning or end. "Texas" explores parallels between the desolate landscape of West Texas and the idiosyncratic routines of a lonely grandmother. A fragmentary document of her day-to-day life, the film investigates themes of memory, loss, and isolation. Video and sound tracks were composed entirely from materials collected in Midland, Texas in late December. Released 2011.
