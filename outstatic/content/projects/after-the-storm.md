*After the Storm* is an interactive documentary that tells the first-person story of what happens in the wake of a devastating tornado that ripped through central Alabama in 2011.

Commissioned by [**ITVS**](https://itvs.org/)  and released through a partnership between [**Independent Lens and The Washington Post**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2015/04/27/independent-lens-and-the-washington-post-launch-first-joint-online-distribution-venture-after-the-storm/) with generous funding from the MacArthur Foundation, *After the Storm* is a digital convergence of formerly disparate media such as print journalism, television, radio and documentary filmmaking.
