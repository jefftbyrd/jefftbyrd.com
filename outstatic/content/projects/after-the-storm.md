*After the Storm* is an interactive documentary that tells the first-person story of what happens in the wake of a devastating tornado that ripped through central Alabama in 2011.

Commissioned by [ITVS](https://itvs.org/)  and released through a partnership between Independent Lens and The Washington Past with generous funding from the MacArthur Foundation, After the Storm is a digital convergence of formerly disparate media such as print journalism, television, radio and documentary filmmaking.
