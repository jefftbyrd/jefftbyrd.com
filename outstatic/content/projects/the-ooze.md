**Budokan Boys** return, summoning eight tracks of surreal no-wave psychedelic folklore: creation stories, damnation stories, tales of magic and cosmic horror. The grand, wide-angle arrangements—pulsing electronics punctuated by bleating horns, hyperreal foley samples, and drunk-stumbling rhythms—conjure up a warped, dream-state sonic landscape perfectly suited to the lyrics' bent, chimerical legends and alternate mythologies. Like a trickster apparition, THE OOZE leads the listener deep into the moonlit woods of the mind—full of enchanted artefacts, malicious entities, and sublime secrets—with no real intention of bringing them back.

Recorded by Budokan Boys in Berlin, Vienna, and Vlastislav.\
Produced by Jeff T Byrd.\
Mastering and additional mixing by James Plotkin.
